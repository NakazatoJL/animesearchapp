This project was created from scratch with EJS, Node.js, Express.js for getting a deeper understanding on how to interact with a public API and translate its results in a readable page, dealing with GraphQL was also a new and interesting challenge. 

Feel free to clone it, remember to install the node modules by running "npm install" or "npm i", run with "node index.js" within the folder you put the project.

Feel free to edit or customize it, just remember to credit me if you do.
